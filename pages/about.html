            <p class="lead">Welcome to WatLock. On our team we have four major subteams: Mechanical, Electrical, Research and Business.</p>

                    The mechanical team is responsible for the design of all subsystems and components of the airlock. This includes all of the necessary systems to support life on Mars such as depressurization, sealing, and structural support systems
                    as well as unique functionalities such as a modular structure to allow for easier transportation. We
                    work hand-in-hand with the electrical and research teams, who provide support for our projects to ensure
                    our designs are feasible and low cost. Members on the mechanical team perform a large amount of hand
                    drawing and then proceed to complete designs with simulations, modelling, and calculations using SolidWorks.

                    The electrical team plays a vital role into the design of almost every part of the airlock. We focus on many “mission critical”
                    systems such as life support and pressure control. Our work centers on the computing system of our airlock
                    and the autonomy of almost all systems. Members of the electrical team spend a great deal of their time
                    with microcontrollers, circuit design software and communication protocols. This work in combination
                    with that of the mechanical and research teams allow us to build complex systems within the airlock that
                    ensure astronauts are safe and able to focus on other tasks.

                    The research team is responsible for designing innovative solutions to address the prominent issues of space settlement.
                    Projects the research tackles includes generating an air supply to the airlock, creating a flexible and
                    strong fabric that will protect against dust storms and radiation, and producing energy in a sustainable
                    way. The team does a lot of lab testing and prototyping to assist the mechanical and electrical team
                    with their projects which are then combined into the final design of the airlock.

                    The business team addresses the team’s financial concerns and helps the team in reaching its goals. Without adequate funding,
                    building an airlock for a mars colony would just be our dream. The team is responsible for maintaining
                    the website, marketing the team throughout the University, and making pivotal project management decisions
                    that will help the team.
