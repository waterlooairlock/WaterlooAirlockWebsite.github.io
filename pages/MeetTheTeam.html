        <p class='animated bounceInUp responsive' data-id='2' style="font-size: 1.1em">WatLock is a multidisciplinary
            team consisting of over 50 students from faculties across the University of Waterloo. Our members are 
            organized in three major teams: Mechanical, Electrical and Business/Communications.</p>

    <div class="main-container team">

        <!-- Our Fall 2020 Plan -->
        <div class="text-center center-block">
            <h3>Our Fall 2020 Plan</h3>
            <p>Since this term is being held online, WatLock will focus on learning by running workshops and tutorials 
                for team members. By sharing knowledge and building up our skills, we can hit the ground running once 
                fabrication on campus is safe to begin. We will also finalize the design of the airlock, plan its 
                construction, secure sponsorship for the team, and complete other critical tasks that can be 
                addressed virtually.<br><br>
                This term, there will be no specific projects for members to join. The team will be split into its 
                three subteams, Mechanical, Electrical, and Business, and members of each subteam will be able to 
                participate in any facet of their subteam. We'll use Microsoft Teams to host meetings and communicate. 
                You can read more about the goals and responsibilities of each team below.<br><br>
            </p>

            <p><br>Term Goals:
                <ol>
                    <li>Finalizing the Depressurization System, Floor Panels, Arches, Fabrics, Hatches, and Heating/Cooling Designs.<br>
                        For the most part all systems are designed, the next step is integrating them with each other (and with the electrical team). 
                        Most people will be working on combinations of these as needed, unless members have specific interests or specialties.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Preparing to build as soon as we are allowed back on campus. This includes:
                        <ul class="team-ul">
                            <li class="team-li">
                                Working with the business team to purchase as much as we can this semester
                            </li>
                            <li class="team-li">
                                Familiarizing everyone with the project through a variety of relevant tutorials (Space science, structural engineering, radiation and filtration systems, SolidWorks and ANSYS, thermodynamics, etc.).
                                We want to make sure members understand the underlying principles behind what is being built.
                            </li>
                            <li class="team-li">
                                Getting anyone who will be building ready (safety training, approval). This is for either stream, 
                                we hope to build in both winter and summer 2021!
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                <br>The Electrical team is in charge of the UI the astronauts will use to view and control the airlock's 
                data, as well as the organization and management of that data with the airlock's sensors. 
                <br><br>
                <b>User Interface</b>
                <br>
                The UI will be a desktop app, currently planned to be built in Python, React, and Electron. 
                We have a preliminary design detailing the look of the app and its desired functionality.
                <br><br>
                <b>Servers and Data Management</b>
                <br>
                All sensors inside the airlock will be connected to the central computer via Arduino. Code to 
                analyze, control, and respond to the sensors is written in C.
                <br><br>
                Our goal for this term is to have our members ready to build by learning together and running 
                tutorials. We may begin coding this term depending on the progress of this subteam and WatLock’s 
                overall future outlook. We will also work with the Mechanical team to plan how each system will interact.
                <br><br>
                Some technologies you might use are C, React, Git, Arduino, embedded systems, sensors, and design! 
                Tech is a malleable field, so these are subject to change depending on your own interests and which 
                tools the team thinks would work best.

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                <br>The Business Team’s responsibilities include:
                <ul class="team-ul">
                    <li class="team-li">Obtaining sponsorships and funds to help finance the build phase of the airlock (hopefully) occurring in winter 2020 and spring 2020.</li>
                    <li class="team-li">Pitching to potential sponsors and contacting potential sponsors</li>
                    <li class="team-li">Seeking out suppliers for funded parts of the airlock for the upcoming build phase</li>
                    <li class="team-li">Tracking funds we receive from student funding groups and sponsors</li>
                    <li class="team-li">Updating sponsors with our progress and status in the competition</li>
                    <li class="team-li">Organizing the costs of the competition </li>
                    <li class="team-li">Website maintenance and development</li>
                    <li class="team-li">Seeking opportunities for collaboration</li>
                    <li class="team-li">Promotion of the team on social media to gain interest in what we do</li>
                    <li class="team-li">Design Team merchandise </li>
                    <li class="team-li">Organize Team socials<br><br></li>
                </ul>

                How we will meet during an online term:<br>
                We will be having weekly online meetings on Teams that will be scheduled according to team member’s 
                schedules to discuss and update the progress of ongoing projects. Tutorials will be run for team members 
                looking to develop their skills. We will be working closely with the other two teams to ensure that all 
                necessary parts of the airlock are financed. <br><br>

                This term’s main goal is to obtain a large amount of funding and place orders for materials to aid in the 
                construction of the airlock that is hopefully occurring by Winter 2020. We are also hoping to gain funds to 
                finance our travel costs of transporting an entire airlock across Canada to UBC!<br><br>

                Managing niche areas such as social media updates or website development are usually done independently or 
                in small groups and individuals will be screened by the Business Team Lead before assignment. The Social 
                Media role includes collecting pictures of work done by the Mechanical and Electrical teams, promotion of 
                material related to our project, promotion of our sponsors, and more. The Website Development role includes 
                making major updates to our websites such as our current team, status, and sponsors. If you have an 
                interest in these areas, please don’t hesitate to include that in your application!
